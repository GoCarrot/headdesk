# Headdesk

Because we've all been there with Android.

`headdesk` automatically detects common issues with Android APKs. These are errors that we (at Teak) commonly see in customer support. It's like unit testing for your build system.

This is output from the check that ensures that the version of the Facebook SDK (if present) has not been deprecated:

      âœ” Facebook SDK version
          â†³ âœ” APK contains class com.facebook.FacebookSdk
          â†³ âœ” com.facebook.FacebookSdk contains getSdkVersion method
          â†³ âœ” Found Facebook SDK version 4.33.0
          â†³ âœ” Facebook SDK was released in the last 2 years (using 4.33.0, released 2018-05-01)
          ðŸ’¾ {"facebook_sdk":{"major":4,"minor":33,"patch":0,"version":"4.33.0","date":"2018-05-01"}}

`headdesk` can also output to JSON.

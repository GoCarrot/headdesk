# Headdesk

Because we've all been there with Android.

`headdesk` automatically detects common issues with Android APKs. These are errors that we (at Teak) commonly see in customer support. It's like unit testing for your build system.

This is output from the check that ensures that the version of the Facebook SDK (if present) has not been deprecated:

    âœ” Facebook SDK version (https://github.com/GoCarrot/headdesk/blob/0.5.0/docs/facebook.md)

        â†³ âœ” APK contains class com.facebook.FacebookSdk
        â†³ âœ” com.facebook.FacebookSdk contains getSdkVersion method
        â†³ âœ” Found Facebook SDK version 4.33.0
        â†³ âœ” Facebook SDK was released in the last 2 years (using 4.33.0, released 2018-05-01)
        ðŸ’¾ {"facebook_sdk":{"major":4,"minor":33,"patch":0,"version":"4.33.0","date":"2018-05-01"}}

`headdesk` can also output to JSON.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'headdesk'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install headdesk

## Usage

Command line usage instruction:

    $ headdesk

    $ headdesk help [COMMAND]

### analyze -- Analyze an APK

    $ headdesk analyze [APK]

This will unpack the APK to a temporary path, analyze and print to STDOUT the results in plaintext.

For JSON output pass `--json`.

    $ headdesk analyze --path [path to unpacked APK]

This will analyze an already unpacked APK.

### unpack -- Unpack an APK

    $ headdesk unpack APK [DESTINATION]

This will unpack an APK to the specified DESTINATION, or to the current working directory.

    $ headdesk unpack APK [DESTINATION] --analyze

This will unpack an APK to the specified DESTINATION, or to the current working directory, and then perform analysis.

### blame -- Find Symbols Inside AAR/JAR Files

    $ headdesk blame SYMBOL [PATH]

This will search for all JAR and AAR files in PATH for SYMBOL, and display matching packages and symbols.

PATH defaults to the current directory.

For JSON output pass `--json`.

## headdesk-lambda
You can use `headdesk` easily from anywhere, without installing anything, using the hosted version.

### Usage

Command line usage instruction:

Single Command:

    $ curl -w "%{url_effective}" --upload-file "PATH_TO_YOUR_APK_FILE" \
        -L "`curl https://headdesk.cli-apps.teak.io/v1/url`" | \
        curl --data @- --retry 10 https://headdesk.cli-apps.teak.io/v1/analyze

Replace `PATH_TO_YOUR_APK_FILE` with the path to the APK file you want to analyze.

### What this Does
1. Requests a URL to upload the APK
    * `curl https://headdesk.cli-apps.teak.io/v1/url`
2. Upload the APK to that URL, and write to STDOUT the URL it just used to upload
    * `curl -w "%{url_effective}" --upload-file "PATH_TO_YOUR_APK_FILE" -L [Result from Step 1]`
3. Invoke the 'analyze' endpoint, passing the result from Step 2 as the data (via reading from STDIN)
    * `curl --data @- --retry 10 https://headdesk.cli-apps.teak.io/v1/analyze`

## Development
